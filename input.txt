The true origin of Ungoliant is unknown, and was not even known by the Valar. It is said by some that she came from the Darkness itself that lies about Arda and was once an ally of Melkor when he looked down upon the world with envy. Later, she changed her allegiance from him to herself, desiring only to be a mistress of her own insatiable craving to devour all light - to feed her everlasting emptiness.
